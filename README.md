# Full Pack by sakulmore
This Full Pack is inspired by the [Base Pack](https://github.com/AMXX-pl/BasePack)!

This Full Pack includes the latest versions of AMXModX, Reunion, VoiceTranscoder, etc... for Counter-Strike 1.6. Everything that this pack contains can be found below.

This Full Pack also includes the corrected geop.inc and GeoLite2-City.mmdb files.

I update this pack every Sunday evening (if there is/are a new version/s available).

### Installation
- We will need a clean installation of the game server Counter-Strike 1.6.

- After installing the server, we will download the latest Release.

- We will copy and replace all files into the main server folder (/).

- Then we need to chmod the files to 0777 (otherwise an error would be displayed in the server console, indicating that the files do not have permission).

- Done.
